# PythonTextToAudio
PYTHON SCRIPT TO CONVERT THE USER-INPUT TEXT TO AUDIO FILE AND PLAY THE SAVED AUDIO FILE using gTTS and pygame modules of Python.

gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), a Python library and CLI tool to interface with Google Translateâ€™s text-to-speech API. Writes spoken mp3 data to a file, a file-like object (bytestring) for further audio manipulation, or stdout. It features flexible pre-processing and tokenizing.

pygame is a Free and Open Source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games on Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries to abstract most common functions and makes writing these program a more intuitive task.
